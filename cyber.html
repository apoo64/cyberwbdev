     <h1>Cyber Crime Awareness blogs</h1>
     <p>While online threats are constantly evolving, many cyber criminals use variations of the same methods with cyber attacks. 
         Specifics of these attacks may differ, but the nature of the attacks stay the same. Cyber criminals take advantage of a user’s 
         lack of technical expertise and inherent trusting natures. By understanding these common threats and risks, we can all 
         take steps to protect ourselves online.

                 <p>US military personnel and veterans have lost more than $822 million to scams since 2017, according to researchers at AtlasVPN. The researchers analyzed data from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and found that reservists and military families, lost the most money to scams ($484.4 million), followed by veterans and retirees.

                    “The veterans & military retirees’ financial damages encompass 35% of all losses at $290.1 million,” the researchers write. “This group fell to various types of internet crime most often, as they sent out a total of 452 thousand reports. The median loss in this category is $700. Finally, fraudsters swindled over $47.6 million from active duty service members. This group also submitted the least complaints at 52 thousand since 2017. The median loss for active duty service members is one hundred lower than that of veterans, at $600.”</p>
