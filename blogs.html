                     Why the 'Basement Hacker' Stereotype Is Wrong — and Dangerous
                  </h3>
                  <p>Basement Hacker represents a fundamental and ongoing misunderstanding of the modern cyber adversary. The Basement Hacker myth gives organizations of all sizes a false sense of superiority over threat actors, whom they perceive as untrained, benign, and weird. Gone unchecked, this sense of superiority can spur complacency among risk managers and executives who determine security budgets, leading to underinvestment in security teams, overreliance on automation, or both.
                     If we counter the harm of the Basement Hacker stereotype, C-level leaders will more readily acknowledge that professionalized threat groups pose a security risk to organizations of any size and across all industry sectors. To achieve this outcome, we should avoid perpetuating the Basement Hacker idea wherever possible. We must also counter this narrative by disseminating a clear-eyed, comprehensive picture of modern threat groups.

              <h3>Imunify360 Bug Leaves Linux Web Servers Open to Code Execution, Takeover</h3>
              <p>CloudLinux’s security platform for Linux-based websites and web servers contains a high-severity PHP deserialization bug.
                 Imunify360 is a security platform for Linux-based web servers that allows users to configure various settings for real-time website protection and web-server security.
                 According to researchers at Cisco Talos, the bug (CVE-2021-21956) specifically resides in the Ai-Bolit scanning functionality of the Imunift360, which allows webmasters and site administrators to search for viruses, vulnerabilities and malware code.
                 The bug, which rates 8.2 out of 10 on the CVSSv3.0 vulnerability-severity scale, can lead to a deserialization condition with controllable data that would allow an attacker to then execute arbitrary code.
                 There are a couple of ways for an attacker to carry out an exploit in the real world, researchers said. For one, if Imunify360 is configured with real-time file system scanning, the attacker need only create a malicious file in the system, they noted.

              <h3>GoDaddy Breach Exposes SSL Keys of Managed WordPress Hosting Customers</h3>
              <p>
                 A data breach at GoDaddy exposed SSL keys issued to an undisclosed — but likely large — number of active customers using its Managed WordPress website hosting service. The incident has sparked concerns about attackers hijacking domains for ransomware or spoofing them for credential theft and other malicious purposes.
                 GoDaddy, a major domain registrar and website hosting company, on Monday announced it had discovered a data breach on Nov. 17 that exposed data belonging to a total of 1.2 million active and inactive customers of Managed WordPress. Exposed data included the email address and customer number associated with the WordPress accounts; the default WordPress admin password that was set when the account was first provisioned; and SFTP and database username and passwords. SSL keys belonging to a subset of the 1.2 million affected customers also were exposed, GoDaddy said in a regulatory statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
